<p class='firstunderline'>ERG2012 USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>The 2012 Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG2012) was developed jointly by Transport Canada (TC), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Secretariat of Transport and Communications of Mexico (SCT) and with the collaboration of CIQUIME (Centro de Información Química para Emergencias) of Argentina, for use by fire fighters, police, and other emergency services personnel who may be the first to arrive at the scene of a transportation incident involving dangerous goods. <b>It is primarily a guide to aid first responders in quickly identifying the specific or generic hazards of the material(s) involved in the incident, and protecting themselves and the general public during the initial response phase of the incident.</b> For the purposes of this guidebook, the “initial response phase” is that period following arrival at the scene of an incident during which the presence and/or identification of dangerous goods is confirmed, protective actions and area securement are initiated, and assistance of qualified personnel is requested. It is not intended to provide information on the physical or chemical properties of dangerous goods.</p>

<p>This guidebook will assist responders in making initial decisions upon arriving at the scene of a dangerous goods incident. It should not be considered as a substitute for emergency response training, knowledge or sound judgment. ERG2012 does not address all possible circumstances that may be associated with a dangerous goods incident. It is primarily designed for use at a dangerous goods incident occurring on a highway or railroad. Be mindful that there may be limited value in its application at fixed facility locations.</p>

<p>ERG2012 incorporates dangerous goods lists from the most recent United Nations Recommendations as well as from other international and national regulations. Explosives are not listed individually by either proper shipping name or ID Number. They do, however, appear under the general heading “Explosives” on the first page of the ID Number index (yellow-bordered pages) and alphabetically in the Name of Material index (blue-bordered pages). Also, the letter <b>(P)</b> following the guide number in the yellow-bordered and blue- bordered pages identifies those materials which present a polymerization hazard under certain conditions, for example: Acrolein, stabilized <b>131P</b>.</p>

<p>First responders at the scene of a dangerous goods incident should seek additional specific information about any material in question as soon as possible. The information received by contacting the appropriate emergency response agency, by calling the emergency response telephone number on the shipping document, or by consulting the information on or accompanying the shipping document, may be more specific and accurate than this guidebook in providing guidance for the materials involved.</p>

<p><b><u>BEFORE AN EMERGENCY</u> – BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THIS GUIDEBOOK!</b> In the U.S., according to the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.120), and regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 40 CFR Part 311), first responders must be trained regarding the use of this guidebook.</p>
<p class='firstunderline'>GUIDEBOOK CONTENTS</p>
<p><b>1-Yellow-bordered pages:</b> Index list of dangerous goods in numerical order of ID number. This section quickly identifies the guide to be consulted from the ID Number of the material involved. This list displays the 4-digit ID number of the material followed by its assigned emergency response guide and the material name.</p>
For example:
<table>
<tr><td><b>ID No.</b></td><td><b>GUIDE No.</b></td><td><b>Name of Material</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1090</td><td>127</td><td>Acetone</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>2-Blue-bordered pages:</b> Index list of dangerous goods in alphabetical order of material name. This section quickly identifies the guide to be consulted from the name of the material involved. This list displays the name of the material followed by its assigned emergency response guide and 4-digit ID number.</p>

For example:
<table>
<tr><td><b>Name of Material</b></td><td><b>GUIDE No.</b></td><td><b>ID No.</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Sulfuric acid</td><td>127</td><td>1830</td></tr>
</table>
<p><b>3-Orange-bordered pages:</b> This section is the most important section of the guidebook because it is where all safety recommendations are provided. It comprises a total of 62 individual guides, presented in a two-page format. Each guide provides safety recommendations and emergency response information to protect yourself and the public. The left hand page provides safety related information whereas the right hand page provides emergency response guidance and activities for fire situations, spill or leak incidents and first aid. Each guide is designed to cover a group of materials which possess similar chemical and toxicological characteristics.</p>
<p>The guide title identifies the general hazards of the dangerous goods covered.</p>

<p><b>For example:	GUIDE 124</b> - Gases-Toxic and/or Corrosive-Oxidizing.</p>

<p>Each guide is divided into three main sections: the first section describes <b><u>potential hazards</u></b> that the material may display in terms of fire/explosion and health effects upon exposure. The highest potential is listed first. The emergency responder should consult this section first. This allows the responder to make decisions regarding the protection of the emergency response team as well as the surrounding population.</p>
<p>The second section outlines suggested <b><u>public safety</u></b> measures based on the situation at hand. It provides general information regarding immediate isolation of the incident site, recommended type of protective clothing and respiratory protection. Suggested evacuation distances are listed for small and large spills and for fire situations (fragmentation hazard). It also directs the reader to consult the tables listing Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) materials, chemical warfare agents and water-reactive materials (green-bordered pages) when the material is highlighted in the yellow-bordered and blue-bordered pages.</p>
<p>The third section covers <b><u>emergency response</u></b> actions, including first aid. It outlines special precautions for incidents which involve fire, spill or chemical exposure. Several recommendations are listed under each part which will further assist in the decision making process. The information on first aid is general guidance prior to seeking medical care.</p>
<p><b>4-Green-bordered pages:</b> This section contains three tables.</p>
<p><b>Table 1</b> lists, by ID number order, TIH materials, including certain chemical warfare agents, and water-reactive materials which produce toxic gases upon contact with water. This table provides two different types of recommended safe distances which are "Initial isolation distances" and "Protective action distances". The materials are highlighted in green for easy identification in both numeric (yellow-bordered pages) and alphabetic (blue-bordered pages) lists of the guidebook. This table provides distances for both small (approximately 208 liters (55 US gallons) or less for liquids and 300 kilograms (660 pounds) or less for solids when spilled in water) and large spills (more than 208 liters (55 US gallons) for liquids and more than 300 kilograms (660 pounds) for solids when spilled in water) for all highlighted materials. The list is further subdivided into daytime and nighttime situations. This is necessary due to varying atmospheric conditions which greatly affect the size of the hazardous area. The distances change from daytime to nighttime due to different mixing and dispersion conditions in the air. During the night, the air is generally calmer and this causes the material to disperse less and therefore create a toxic zone which is greater than would usually occur during the day. During the day, a more active atmosphere will cause a greater dispersion of the material resulting in a lower concentration of the material in the surrounding air. The actual area where toxic levels are reached will be smaller (due to increased dispersion). In fact, it is the quantity or concentration of the material vapor that poses problems not its mere presence.</p>
<p>The "Initial Isolation Distance" is a distance within which all persons should be considered for evacuation in <u>all directions</u> from the actual spill/leak source. It is a distance (radius) which defines a circle (Initial Isolation Zone) within which persons may be exposed to dangerous concentrations upwind of the source and may be exposed to life threatening concentrations downwind of the source. For example, in the case of Compressed gas, toxic, n.o.s., ID No. 1955, Inhalation Hazard Zone A, the isolation distance for small spills is 100 meters (300 feet), therefore, representing an evacuation circle of 200 meters (600 feet) in diameter.</p>
<p>For the same material, the "Protective Action Distance" for a small spill is 0.5 kilometers (0.3 mile) for a daytime incident and 2.2 kilometers (1.4 miles) for a nighttime incident, these distances represent a downwind distance from the spill/leak source within which Protective Actions could be implemented. Protective Actions are those steps taken to preserve the health and safety of emergency responders and the public. People in this area could be evacuated and/or sheltered in-place. For more information, consult pages 285 to 291.</p>
<p><b><u>What is a TIH?</u></b> It is a gas or volatile liquid which is known to be so toxic to humans as to pose a hazard to health during transportation, or in the absence of adequate data on human toxicity, is presumed to be toxic to humans because when tested on laboratory animals it has a Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50) value of not more than 5000 ppm.</p>
<p>It is important to note that even though the term zone is used, the hazard zones do not represent any actual area or distance. The assignment of the zones is strictly a function of their Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50); for example, TIH Zone A is more toxic than Zone D. All distances which are listed in the green-bordered pages are calculated by the use of mathematical models for each TIH material. For the assignment of hazard zones refer to the glossary.</p>
<p><b>Table 2</b> lists, by ID number order, materials that produce large amounts of Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) gases when spilled in water and identifies the TIH gases produced. These Water Reactive materials are easily identified in <b>Table 1</b> as their name is immediately followed by (<b>when spilled in water</b>). Some Water Reactive materials are also TIH materials themselves (e.g., Bromine trifluoride (1746), Thionyl chloride (1836), etc.). In these instances, two entries are provided in Table 1 for land-based and water-based spills. If the Water Reactive material is NOT a TIH and this material is NOT spilled in water, <b>Table 1</b> and <b>Table 2</b> do not apply and safety distances will be found within the appropriate orange-bordered guide.</p>
<p><b>Table 3</b> provides, by alphabetical order of material name, initial isolation and protective action distances for six Toxic Inhalation Hazard materials that may be more commonly encountered. The selected materials are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ammonia, anhydrous (UN1005)
	<li>Chlorine (UN1017)
	<li>Ethylene oxide (UN1040)
	<li>Hydrogen chloride (UN1050) and Hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid (UN2186)
	<li>Hydrogen fluoride (UN1052)
	<li>Sulfur dioxide/Sulphur dioxide (UN1079)
</ul>
<p>The table provides Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for large spills (more than 208 liters or 55 US gallons) involving different container types (therefore different volume capacities) for day time and night time situations and different wind speeds.</p>
<p class='firstunderline'>ISOLATION AND EVACUATION DISTANCES</p>
<p>Isolation or evacuation distances are shown in the guides (orange-bordered pages) and in the Table 1 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances (green-bordered pages). This may confuse users not thoroughly familiar with ERG2012.</p>
<p>It is important to note that some guides refer only to non-TIH materials (36 guides), some refer to both TIH and non-TIH materials (21 guides) and some (5 guides) refer only to TIH or Water-reactive materials (WRM). A guide refers to both TIH and non-TIH materials (for example see GUIDE 131) when the following sentence appears under the title EVACUATION- Spill: “See Table 1 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for highlighted materials. For non-highlighted materials, increase, in the downwind direction, as necessary, the isolation distance shown under ‘PUBLIC SAFETY.’” A guide refers only to TIH or WRM materials (for example see GUIDE 124) when the following sentence appears under the title EVACUATION-Spill: “See Table 1 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances”. If the previous sentences do not appear in a guide, then this particular guide refers only to non-TIH materials (for example see GUIDE 128).</p>
<p>In order to identify appropriate isolation and protective action distances, use the following:</p>
<p>If you are dealing with a <b>TIH/WRM/Chemical warfare</b> material (highlighted entries in the index lists), the isolation and evacuation distances are found directly in the green-bordered pages. The guides (orange-bordered pages) also remind the user to refer to the green-bordered pages for evacuation specific information involving highlighted materials.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with a <b>non-TIH material but the guide refers to both TIH and non-TIH materials</b>, an immediate isolation distance is provided under the heading PUBLIC SAFETY as a precautionary measure to prevent injuries. It applies to the non-TIH materials only. In addition, for evacuation purposes, the guide informs the user under the title EVACUATION- Spill to increase, for non-highlighted materials, in the downwind direction, if necessary, the immediate isolation distance listed under “PUBLIC SAFETY”. For example, GUIDE 131 – Flammable Liquids-Toxic, instructs the user to: "As an immediate precautionary measure, isolate spill or leak area for at least 50 meters (150 feet) in all directions." In case of a large spill, the isolation area could be expanded from 50 meters (150 feet) to a distance deemed as safe by the On-scene commander and emergency responders.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with a non-TIH material and the guide refers only to non-TIH materials, the immediate isolation and evacuation distances are specified as actual distances in the guide (orange-bordered pages) and are not referenced in the green-bordered pages.</p>
<p><b>Note 1:</b><blockquote>If an entry is highlighted in green in either the yellow-bordered or blue-bordered pages AND THERE IS NO FIRE, go directly to Table 1 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances (green-bordered pages) and look up the ID number and name of material to obtain initial isolation and protective action distances. IF THERE IS A FIRE, or IF A FIRE IS INVOLVED, ALSO CONSULT the assigned guide (orange-bordered pages) and apply as appropriate the evacuation information shown under PUBLIC SAFETY.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Note 2:</b><blockquote>If the name in <b>Table 1</b> is shown with “<b>When Spilled In Water</b>”, these materials produce large amounts of Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) gases when spilled in water. Some Water Reactive materials are also TIH materials themselves (e.g., Bromine trifluoride (1746), Thionyl chloride (1836), etc.). In these instances, two entries are provided in <b>Table 1</b> for land-based and water-based spills. If the Water Reactive material is <b>NOT</b> a TIH and this material is <b>NOT</b> spilled in water, <b>Table 1</b> and <b>Table 2</b> do not apply and safety distances will be found within the appropriate orange-bordered guide.</blockquote></p>
<p class='firstunderline'>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</p>
<p><b>Street Clothing and Work Uniforms.</b> These garments, such as uniforms worn by police and emergency medical services personnel, provide almost no protection from the harmful effects of dangerous goods.</p>
<p><b>Structural Fire Fighters’ Protective Clothing (SFPC)</b>. This category of clothing, often called turnout or bunker gear, means the protective clothing normally worn by fire fighters during structural fire fighting operations. It includes a helmet, coat, pants, boots, gloves and a hood to cover parts of the head not protected by the helmet and facepiece. This clothing must be used with full-facepiece positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). This protective clothing should, at a minimum, meet the OSHA Fire Brigades Standard (29 CFR 1910.156). Structural fire fighters’ protective clothing provides limited protection from heat and cold, but may not provide adequate protection from the harmful vapors or liquids that are encountered during dangerous goods incidents. Each guide includes a statement about the use of SFPC in incidents involving those materials referenced by that guide. Some guides state that SFPC provides limited protection. In those cases, the responder wearing SFPC and SCBA may be able to perform an expedient, that is quick “in-and-out”, operation. However, this type of operation can place the responder at risk of exposure, injury or death. The incident commander makes the decision to perform this operation only if an overriding benefit can be gained (i.e., perform an immediate rescue, turn off a valve to control a leak, etc.). The coverall-type protective clothing customarily worn to fight fires in forests or wildlands is not SFPC and is not recommended nor referred to elsewhere in this guidebook.</p>
<p><b>Positive Pressure Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA)</b>. This apparatus provides a constant, positive pressure flow of air within the facepiece, even if one inhales deeply while doing heavy work. Use apparatus certified by NIOSH and the Department of Labor/Mine Safety and Health Administration in accordance with 42 CFR Part 84. Use it in accordance with the requirements for respiratory protection specified in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 (Respiratory Protection) and/or 29 CFR 1910.156 (f) (Fire Brigades Standard). Chemical-cartridge respirators or other filtering masks are not acceptable substitutes for positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus. Demand-type SCBA does not meet the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.156 (f)(1)(i) of the Fire Brigades Standard. If it is suspected that a Chemical Warfare Agent (CW) is involved, the use of NIOSH-certified respirators with CBRN protection are highly recommended.</p>
<p><b>Chemical Protective Clothing and Equipment</b>. Safe use of this type of protective clothing and equipment requires specific skills developed through training and experience. It is generally not available to, or used by, first responders. This type of special clothing may protect against one chemical, yet be readily permeated by chemicals for which it was not designed. Therefore, protective clothing should not be used unless it is compatible with the released material. This type of special clothing offers little or no protection against heat and/ or cold. Examples of this type of equipment have been described as (1) Vapor Protective Suits (NFPA 1991), also known as Totally-Encapsulating Chemical Protective (TECP) Suits or Level A* protection (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, Appendix A & B), and (2) Liquid-Splash Protective Suits (NFPA 1992 & 1993), also known as Level B* or C* protection (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, Appendix A & B) or suits for chemical/biological terrorism incidents (NFPA 1994), class 1, 2 or 3 Ensembles and Standard CAN/CGSB/CSA-Z1610-11 – Protection of first responders from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events (2011). No single protective clothing material will protect you from all dangerous goods. Do not assume any protective clothing is resistant to cold and/or heat or flame exposure unless it is so certified by the manufacturer (NFPA 1991 5-3 Flammability Resistance Test and 5-6 Cold Temperature Performance Test).</p>
<p>* Consult glossary for additional protection levels under the heading “Protective Clothing”.</p>
<p class='firstunderline'>FIRE AND SPILL CONTROL</p>
<p><b>FIRE CONTROL</b></p>
<p>Water is the most common and generally most available fire extinguishing agent. Exercise caution in selecting a fire extinguishing method since there are many factors to be considered in an incident. Water may be ineffective in fighting fires involving some materials; its effectiveness depends greatly on the method of application.</p>
<p>Fires involving a spill of flammable liquids are generally controlled by applying a fire fighting foam to the surface of the burning material. Fighting flammable liquid fires requires foam concentrate which is <u>chemically compatible</u> with the burning material, <u>correct mixing</u> of the foam concentrate with water and air, and <u>careful application and maintenance</u> of the foam blanket. There are two general types of fire fighting foam: regular and alcohol-resistant. Examples of regular foam are protein-base, fluoroprotein, and aqueous film forming foam (AFFF). Some flammable liquids, including many petroleum products, can be controlled by applying regular foam. Other flammable liquids, including polar solvents (flammable liquids which are water soluble) such as alcohols and ketones, have different chemical properties. A fire involving these materials cannot be easily controlled with regular foam and requires application of alcohol-resistant foam. Polar-solvent fires may be difficult to control and require a higher foam application rate than other flammable liquid fires (see NFPA/ANSI Standards 11 and 11A for further information). Refer to the appropriate guide to determine which type of foam is recommended. Although it is impossible to make specific recommendations for flammable liquids which have subsidiary corrosive or toxic hazards, alcohol-resistant foam may be effective for many of these materials. The emergency response telephone number on the shipping document, or the appropriate emergency response agency, should be contacted as soon as possible for guidance on the proper fire extinguishing agent to use. The final selection of the agent and method depends on many factors such as incident location, exposure hazards, size of the fire, environmental concerns, as well as the availability of extinguishing agents and equipment at the scene.</p>
<p><b>WATER REACTIVE MATERIALS</b></p>
<p>Water is sometimes used to flush spills and to reduce or direct vapors in spill situations. Some of the materials covered by the guidebook can react violently or even explosively with water. In these cases, consider letting the fire burn or leaving the spill alone (except to prevent its spreading by diking) until additional technical advice can be obtained. The applicable guides clearly warn you of these potentially dangerous reactions. These materials require technical advice since</p>
<ol>
<li class='c'>water getting inside a ruptured or leaking container may cause an explosion;</li>
<li class='c'>water may be needed to cool adjoining containers to prevent their rupturing (exploding) or further spread of the fires;</li>
<li class='c'>water may be effective in mitigating an incident involving a water-reactive material only if it can be applied at a sufficient flooding rate for an extended period; and</li>
<li class='c'>the products from the reaction with water may be more toxic, corrosive, or otherwise more undesirable than the product of the fire without water applied.</li>
</ol>
<p>When responding to an incident involving water-reactive materials, take into account the existing conditions such as wind, precipitation, location and accessibility to the incident, as well as the availability of the agents to control the fire or spill. Because there are variables to consider, the decision to use water on fires or spills involving water-reactive materials should be based on information from an authoritative source; for example, a producer of the material, who can be contacted through the emergency response telephone number or the appropriate emergency response agency.</p>
<p><b>VAPOR CONTROL</b></p>
<p>Limiting the amount of vapor released from a pool of flammable or corrosive liquids is an operational concern. It requires the use of proper protective clothing, specialized equipment, appropriate chemical agents, and skilled personnel. Before engaging in vapor control, get advice from an authoritative source as to the proper tactics.</p>
<p>There are several ways to minimize the amount of vapors escaping from pools of spilled liquids, such as special foams, adsorbing agents, absorbing agents, and neutralizing agents. To be effective, these vapor control methods must be selected for the specific material involved and performed in a manner that will mitigate, not worsen, the incident.</p>
<p>Where specific materials are known, such as at manufacturing or storage facilities, it is desirable for the dangerous goods response team to prearrange with the facility operators to select and stockpile these control agents in advance of a spill. In the field, first responders may not have the most effective vapor control agent for the material available. They are likely to have only water and only one type of fire fighting foam on their vehicles. If the available foam is inappropriate for use, they are likely to use water spray. Because the water is being used to form a vapor seal, care must be taken not to churn or further spread the spill during application. Vapors that do not react with water may be directed away from the site using the air currents surrounding the water spray. Before using water spray or other methods to safely control vapor emission or to suppress ignition, obtain technical advice, based on specific chemical name identification.</p>
<p><b>BLEVE</b> (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion)</p>
<p>The following section presents, in a two-page format, background information on BLEVEs and includes a chart that provides important safety-related information to consider when confronted with this type of situation involving Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG), UN1075. LPGs include the following flammable gases; Butane, UN1011; Butylene, UN1012; Isobutylene, UN1055; Propylene, UN2077; Isobutane, UN1969; and Propane, UN1978.</p>

<p><b>What are the main hazards from a BLEVE?</b></p>
<p>The main hazards from a propane or LPG BLEVE are:</p>
<ul>
<li>fire</li>
<li>thermal radiation from the fire</li>
<li>blast</li>
<li>projectiles</li>
</ul>
<p>The danger from these decreases as you move away from the BLEVE centre. The furthest reaching hazard is projectiles.</p>

<p class='firstunderline'>BLEVE – SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</p>
<p><b>Use with caution</b>. The following table gives a summary of tank properties, critical times, critical distances and cooling water flow rates for various tank sizes. This table is provided to give responders some guidance but it should be used with caution.</p>
<p><b>Tank dimensions are approximate</b> and can vary depending on the tank design and application.</p>
<p><b>Minimum time to failure</b> is based on <b>severe torch fire impingement</b> on the vapour space of a tank in good condition, and is approximate. Tanks may fail earlier if they are damaged or corroded. Tanks may fail minutes or hours later than these minimum times depending on the conditions. It has been assumed here that the tanks are not equipped with thermal barriers or water spray cooling.</p>
<p><b>Minimum time to empty</b> is based on an engulfing fire with a properly sized pressure relief valve. If the tank is only partially engulfed then time to empty will increase (i.e., if tank is 50% engulfed then the tanks will take twice as long to empty). Once again, it has been assumed that the tank is not equipped with a thermal barrier or water spray.</p>
<p><b>Tanks equipped with thermal barriers or water spray cooling</b> significantly increase the times to failure and the times to empty. A thermal barrier can reduce the heat input to a tank by a factor of ten or more. This means it could take ten times as long to empty the tank through the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV).</p>
<p><b>Fireball radius and emergency response distance</b> is based on mathematical equations and is approximate. They assume spherical fireballs and this is not always the case.</p>
<p><b>Two safety distances for public evacuation</b>. The minimum distance is based on tanks that are launched with a small elevation angle (i.e., a few degrees above horizontal). This is most common for horizontal cylinders. The preferred evacuation distance has more margin of safety since it assumes the tanks are launched at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal. This might be more appropriate if a vertical cylinder is involved.</p>
<p>It is understood that these distances are very large and may not be practical in a highly populated area. However, it should be understood that the risks increase rapidly the closer you are to a BLEVE. Keep in mind that the furthest reaching projectiles tend to come off in the zones 45 degrees on each side of the tank ends.</p>
<p>Water flow rate is based on 5√capacity (USgal) = usgal/min needed to cool tank metal.</p>
<p><b>Warning</b>: the data given are approximate and should only be used with extreme caution. For example, where times are given for tank failure or tank emptying through the pressure relief valve – these times are typical but they can vary from situation to situation. Therefore, never risk life based on these times.</p>

<p class='firstunderline'>CRIMINAL/TERRORIST USE OF CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL/RADIOLOGICAL AGENTS</p>
<p>The following is intended to supply information to first responders for use in making a preliminary assessment of a situation that they suspect involves criminal/terrorist use of chemical, biological agents and/or radioactive materials (CBRN). To aid in the assessment, a list of observable indicators of the use and/or presence of a CB agent or radioactive material is provided in the following paragraphs. This section ends with a Safe Standoff Distance Chart for various threats when Improvised Explosive Devices are involved.</p>
<p><b>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL AGENT</b></p>
<p>Chemical and biological agents as well as radioactive materials can be dispersed in the air we breathe, the water we drink, or on surfaces we physically contact. Dispersion methods may be as simple as opening a container, using conventional (garden) spray devices, or as elaborate as detonating an improvised explosive device.</p>
<p><b>Chemical Incidents</b> are characterized by the rapid onset of medical symptoms (minutes to hours) and easily observed signatures (colored residue, dead foliage, pungent odor, dead insects and animals).</p>
<p><b>Biological Incidents</b> are characterized by the onset of symptoms in hours to days. Typically, there will be no characteristic signatures because biological agents are usually odorless and colorless. Because of the delayed onset of symptoms in a biological incident, the area affected may be greater due to the movement of infected individuals.</p>
<p><b>Radiological Incidents</b> are characterized by the onset of symptoms, if any, in days to weeks or longer. Typically, there will be no characteristic signatures because radioactive materials are usually odorless and colorless. Specialized equipment is required to determine the size of the affected area, and whether the level of radioactivity presents an immediate or long- term health hazard. Because radioactivity is not detectable without special equipment, the affected area may be greater due to the migration of contaminated individuals.</p>
<p>At the levels created by most probable sources, not enough radiation would be generated to kill people or cause severe illness. In a radiological incident generated by a “dirty bomb”, or Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), in which a conventional explosive is detonated to spread radioactive contamination, the primary hazard is from the explosion. However, certain radioactive materials dispersed in the air could contaminate up to several city blocks, creating fear and possibly panic, and requiring potentially costly cleanup.</p>
<p><b>INDICATORS OF A POSSIBLE CHEMICAL INCIDENT</b></p>
<p><b>Dead animals/birds/fish</b><blockquote>Not just an occasional road kill, but numerous animals (wild and domestic, small and large), birds, and fish in the same area.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Lack of insect life</b><blockquote>If normal insect activity (ground, air, and/or water) is missing, check the ground/water surface/shore line for dead insects. If near water, check for dead fish/aquatic birds.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Unexplained odors</b><<blockquote>Smells may range from fruity to flowery to sharp/pungent to garlic/ horseradish-like to bitter almonds/peach kernels to new mown hay. It is important to note that the particular odor is completely out of character with its surroundings.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Unusual numbers of dying or sick people (mass casualties)</b><blockquote>Health problems including nausea, disorientation, difficulty in breathing, convulsions, localized sweating, conjunctivitis (reddening of eyes/nerve agent symptoms), erythema (reddening of skin/vesicant symptoms) and death.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Pattern of casualties</b><blockquote>Casualties will likely be distributed downwind, or if indoors, by the air ventilation system.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Blisters/rashes</b><blockquote>Numerous individuals experiencing unexplained water-like blisters, weals (like bee stings), and/or rashes.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Illness in confined area</b><blockquote>Different casualty rates for people working indoors versus outdoors dependent on where the agent was released.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Unusual liquid droplets</b><blockquote>Numerous surfaces exhibit oily droplets/film; numerous water surfaces have an oily film. (No recent rain.)</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Different looking areas</b><blockquote>Not just a patch of dead weeds, but trees, shrubs, bushes, food crops, and/or lawns that are dead, discolored, or withered. (No current drought.)</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Low-lying clouds</b><blockquote>Low-lying cloud/fog-like condition that is not consistent with its surroundings.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Unusual metal debris</b>Unexplained bomb/munitions-like material, especially if it contains a liquid.</p>
<p><b>INDICATORS OF A POSSIBLE BIOLOGICAL INCIDENT</b></p>
<p><b>Unusual numbers of sick or dying people or animals</b><blockquote>Any number of symptoms may occur. Casualties may occur hours to days after an incident has occurred. The time required before symptoms are observed is dependent on the agent used.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Unscheduled and unusual spray being disseminated</b><blockquote>Especially if outdoors during periods of darkness.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Abandoned spray devices</b><blockquote>Devices may not have distinct odors.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>INDICATORS OF A POSSIBLE RADIOLOGICAL INCIDENT</b></p>
<p><b>Radiation Symbols</b><blockquote>Containers may display a “propeller” radiation symbol.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Unusual metal debris</b><blockquote>Unexplained bomb/munitions-like material.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Heat-emitting material</b><blockquote>Material that is hot or seems to emit heat without any sign of an external heat source.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Glowing material</b><blockquote>Strongly radioactive material may emit or cause radioluminescence.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>Sick people/animals</b><blockquote>In very improbable scenarios there may be unusual numbers of sick or dying people or animals. Casualties may occur hours to days or weeks after an incident has occurred. The time required before symptoms are observed is dependent on the radioactive material used, and the dose received. Possible symptoms include skin reddening or vomiting.</blockquote></p>
<p><b>PERSONAL SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS</b></p>
<p>When approaching a scene that may involve CB agents or radioactive materials, the most critical consideration is the safety of oneself and other responders. Protective clothing and respiratory protection of appropriate level of safety must be used. In incidents where it is suspected that CBRN materials have been used as weapons, NIOSH-certified respirators with CBRN protection are highly recommended. Be aware that the presence and identification of CB agents or radioactive materials may not be verifiable, especially in the case of biological or radiological agents. The following actions/measures to be considered are applicable to either a chemical, biological or radiological incident. The guidance is general in nature, not all encompassing, and its applicability should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Approach and response strategies. Protect yourself and use a safe approach (minimize any exposure time, maximize the distance between you and the item that is likely to harm you, use cover as protection and wear appropriate personal protective equipment and respiratory protection). Identify and estimate the hazard by using indicators as provided above. Isolate the area and secure the scene; potentially contaminated people should be isolated and decontaminated as soon as possible. To the extent possible, take measures to limit the spread of contamination. In the event of a chemical incident, the fading of chemical odors is not necessarily an indication of reduced vapor concentrations. Some chemicals deaden the senses giving the false perception that the chemical is no longer present.</p>
<p>If there is any indication that an area may be contaminated with radioactive materials, including the site of any non-accidental explosion, responder personnel should be equipped with radiation detection equipment that would alert them if they are entering a radiologically compromised environment, and should have received adequate training in its use. This equipment should be designed in such a way that it can also alert the responders when an unacceptable ambient dose rate or ambient dose has been reached.</p>
<p><b>Initial actions</b> to consider in a potential CBRN/Hazmat Terrorism Event:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using cell phones, radios, etc. within 100 meters (300 feet) of a suspect device
<li>NOTIFY your local police by calling <a href="tel:911">911</a>.
<li>Set up Incident command upwind and uphill of the area.
<li>Do NOT touch or move suspicious packages/containers.
<li>Be cautious regarding potential presence of secondary devices (e.g. Improvised Explosive Devices, IEDs).
<li>Avoid contamination.
<li>Limit access to only those responsible for rescue of victims or assessment of unknown materials or devices.
<li>Evacuate and isolate individuals potentially exposed to dangerous goods/hazardous materials.
<li>Isolate contaminated areas and secure the scene for analysis of material.
</ul>
<p><b>Decontamination measures.</b> Emergency responders should follow standard decontamination procedures (flush-strip-flush). Mass casualty decontamination should begin as soon as possible by stripping (all clothing) and flushing (soap and water). If biological agents are involved or suspected, careful washing and use of a brush are more effective. If chemical agents are suspected, the most important and effective decontamination will be the one done within the first one or two minutes. If possible, further decontamination should be performed using a 0.5% hypochlorite solution (1 part household bleach mixed with 9 parts water). If biological agents are suspected, a contact time of 10 to 15 minutes should be allowed before rinsing. The solution can be used on soft tissue wounds, but must not be used in eyes or open wounds of the abdomen, chest, head, or spine. For further information contact the agencies listed in this guidebook.</p>
<p>For persons contaminated with radioactive material, remove them to a low radiation area if necessary. Remove their clothing and place it in a clearly marked sealed receptacle, such as a plastic bag, for later testing. Use decontamination methods described above, but avoid breaking the skin, e.g., from shaving, or overly vigorous brushing. External radiological contamination on intact skin surface rarely causes a high enough dose to be a hazard to either the contaminated person or the first responders. For this reason, except in very unusual circumstances, an injured person who is also radiologically contaminated should be medically stabilized, taking care to minimize the spread of the contamination to the extent possible, before decontamination measures are initiated.</p>

<li>Based on the maximum amount of material that could reasonably fit into a container or vehicle. Variations possible.
<li>Governed by the ability of an unreinforced building to withstand severe damage or collapse.
<li>Governed by the greater of fragment throw distance or glass breakage/falling glass hazard distance. These distances can be reduced for personnel wearing ballistic protection. Note that the pipe bomb, suicide belt/vest, and briefcase/ suitcase bomb are assumed to have a fragmentation characteristic that requires greater standoff distances than an equal amount of explosives in a vehicle.
<li>Assuming efficient mixing of the flammable gas with ambient air.
<li>Determined by U.S. firefighting practices wherein safe distances are approximately 4 times the flame height. Note that an LPG tank filled with high explosives would require a significantly greater standoff distance than if it were filled with LPG.
