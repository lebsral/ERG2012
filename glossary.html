 or way to apply or distribute water. The water is finely divided to 
provide for high heat absorption. Water spray patterns can range from 
about 10 to 90 degrees. Water spray streams can be used to extinguish or
 control the burning of a fire or to provide exposure protection for 
personnel, equipment, buildings, etc. (This method can be used to absorb
 vapors, knock- down vapors or disperse vapors. Direct a water spray 
(fog), rather than a straight (solid) stream, into the vapor cloud to 
accomplish any of the above).<br><br>Water spray is particularly effective on fires of flammable liquids and <br>volatile solids having flash points above 37.8oC (100oF).<br><br>Regardless of the above, water spray can be used successfully on <br>flammable liquids with low flash points. The effectiveness depends <br>particularly on the method of application. With proper nozzles, even <br>gasoline spill fires of some types have been extinguished when <br>coordinated hose lines were used to sweep the flames off the surface of <br>the liquid. Furthermore, water spray carefully applied has frequently <br>been used with success in extinguishing fires involving flammable <br>liquids with high flash points (or any viscous liquids) by causing <br>frothing to occur only on the surface, and this foaming action blankets <br>and extinguishes the fire.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
