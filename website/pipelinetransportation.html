	<p class='firstunderline'>PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION</p>

	<p>In North America, hazardous materials are transported through millions of miles of underground pipelines and related structures that can contain natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, anhydrous ammonia, carbon dioxide, jet fuel and other commodities. Although pipelines are buried, there are above-ground structures and signs indicating the presence of

		<p class='underlined centered'><b>Gas Pipelines</b></p>

<p><b>Natural Gas Transmission Pipelines</b></p>
<p>Large-diameter, steel pipelines transporting flammable, toxic and non-toxic natural gas at very high pressure.</p>

<p><b>Structures:</b> Compressor Station Buildings, Valves, Metering Stations, and Aerial Patrol Markers.</p>
<p><b>Markers:</b> “Warning, Caution, or Danger” appear at road, railroad, and water crossings, or may be posted at property boundaries and include operator’s emergency Point-of-Contact (POC) and product transported.</p>

<img src = "img/naturalgaspipeline.png"alt = "Natural Gas Pipeline" />



<p><b>Natural Gas Distribution Pipelines</b></p>
<p>Natural gas is delivered directly to customers via distribution pipelines--typically smaller- diameter, lower-pressure pipelines, and can be steel, plastic, or cast iron.</p>

<p><b>Structures:</b> Regulator stations, customer meters and regulators, and valve box covers are the only above-ground indicators of gas distribution pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Gas Gathering and Gas Well Production Pipelines</b></p>
<p>Gas gathering/gas well production pipelines collect “raw” natural gas from wellheads and transport product to gas-processing and/or gas-treating plants. These gathering pipelines carry natural gas mixed with some level of gas liquids, water and, in some areas, contaminants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S).</p>

<p><b>Structures</b> – Compressor Station Buildings, Valves, Metering Stations, and Aerial Patrol Markers.</p>

<p><b>Markers</b> – Often appear at road, railroad, and water crossings. Signs may be posted at property boundaries. Signs include operator’s POC and product transported. Warning, Caution, or Danger will appear on signs.</p>

<img src = "img/poisongaspipeline.png"alt = "Poison Gas Pipeline" />

<p><b>Note: Pipelines transporting natural gas containing dangerous levels of H2S may have signs that say: “Sour Gas” or “Poison Gas”.</b></p>
<p>
<div id="gas_pipeline" class=" guidesection margin-top-none margin-bottom-none"><strong>For Natural Gas Pipeline Incidents</strong></div>
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Two important things to remember:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Never attempt to extinguish a gas fire; this could prolong/worsen incident/cause
another leak in the pipeline.</li>
<li>Never attempt to operate pipeline valves; this could prolong/worsen incident/cause another leak in the pipeline.</li>

</ul>




<p><b>SIGNS OF GAS PIPELINE RUPTURE:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Loud roaring or explosive sound; OR</li>
<li>Large flames and loud roaring noise.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Follow these steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately evacuate area;</li>
<li>Move upwind, away from flames; prevent individuals from entering;</li>
<li>If no flames present, do not start/turn off vehicles/electrical equipment (ex: cell phones, pagers, two-way radios, or lights) as this could cause spark/ignition;</li>
<li>Abandon equipment used in/near area;</li>
<li>If flames present, driving away from area is acceptable;</li>
<li>Move far enough from noise to allow normal conversation;</li>
<li>From safe location, call <b><a href="tel:911">911</a></b> or contact the local fire/law enforcement; and</li>
<li>Notify pipeline operator.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>ANY ONE OF THESE COULD INDICATE A SUSPECTED GAS PIPELINE LEAK:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Whistling/hissing sound;</li>
<li>Distinctive, strong odor, similar to rotten eggs;</li>
<li>Dense fog, mist, or white cloud;</li>
<li>Bubbling in water, ponds, or creeks;</li>
<li>Dust or dirt blowing up from ground; OR</li>
<li>Discolored/dead vegetation above pipeline right-of-way.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Follow these steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Evacuate area to where you can no longer hear, see, or smell gas;</li>
<li>Do not start/turn off vehicles/electrical equipment (ex: cell phones, pagers, two-way radios or lights) as this could cause spark/ignition;</li>
<li>Abandon equipment used in/near the area;</li>
<li>Avoid open flames;</li>
<li>Prevent individuals from entering area;</li>
<li>Call <b>911</b> or contact the local fire/law enforcement from a safe location; and</li>
<li>Notify pipeline operator.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Considerations for Establishing Protective Action Distance:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Type of product (eg. sour vs sweet);</li>
<li>Pressure and diameter of pipe;</li>
<li>Timing of valve closure by utility (quickly for automated valves/longer for manually operated valves);</li>
<li>Dissipation time of gas in pipe once valves are closed;</li>
<li>Heat factor of natural gas;</li>
<li>Local variables such as climate/weather, wind direction, topography, population density, demographics, and fire suppression methods available;</li>
<li>Nearby building construction material/density;</li>
<li>Wild land/urban interface; and</li>
<li>Natural and manmade barriers (highway).</li>
</ul>
