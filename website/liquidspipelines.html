<p class='firstunderline'>Liquids Pipelines</p>


<p><b>Petroleum and Hazardous Liquids Pipelines</b></p>
<p>Crude oil, refined petroleum products, and hazardous liquids often are transported by pipelines and include gasoline, jet fuels, diesel fuel, home heating oils, carbon dioxide and anhydrous ammonia. Sometimes liquids pipelines transport natural gas liquids, which, like carbon dioxide and anhydrous ammonia, rapidly change from liquid to gaseous state when released from a pressurized pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Structures</b> – Storage Tanks, Valves, Pump Stations, Aerial Patrol Markers</p>

<p><b>Markers</b> – Often appear at road, railroad and water crossings, and may be posted at property boundaries. Signs include operator emergency POCs and product transported. Warning, Caution, or Danger appear on signs.</p>

<div id="petro_pipeline" class=" guidesection margin-top-none margin-bottom-none"><strong>For Petroleum and Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Incidents</strong></div>

<p><b>Two important things to remember:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Never attempt to extinguish flame before shutting off supply, as this can cause
formation of explosive mixtures, and</li>
<li>Never attempt to operate pipeline valves. This could prolong/worsen incident–or cause another pipeline leak.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>SIGNS OF LIQUIDS PIPELINE RUPTURE:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Loud roaring, hissing, or explosive sound; OR</li>
<li>Very large flames and loud roaring noise.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Follow these steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately evacuate area;</li>
<li>Move upwind, far from flames, prevent individuals from entering area;</li>
<li>If no flames present, do not start/turn off vehicles/electrical equipment (ex: cell phones, pagers, two-way radios, or lights) as this could cause spark/ignition;</li>
<li>Abandon equipment used in/near the area</li>
<li>Keep traffic away; secure the area;</li>
<li>If flames present, driving away from area is acceptable;</li>
<li>Move far enough away from noise to allow normal conversation;</li>
<li>From safe location, call <b><a href="tel:911">911</a></b>or contact the local fire/law enforcement; and</li>
<li>From a safe area, call toll-free emergency number on right-of-way marker to notify pipeline operator.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>ANY ONE OF THESE COULD INDICATE SUSPECTED LIQUIDS PIPELINE LEAK:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Liquids bubbling up from ground;</li>
<li>“Oil slick” on flowing/standing water;</li>
<li>Flames appearing from ground;</li>
<li>Vapor clouds;</li>
<li>Discolored vegetation or snow; and</li>
<li>Unusual petroleum, skunk or rotten-egg odor.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Follow these steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not drive into vapor cloud;</li>
<li>Carefully evacuate the immediate area so you can no longer hear, see, smell odor;</li>
<li>Avoid introducing sources of ignition--do not start/turn off vehicles/electrical equipment (ex: cell phones, pagers, two-way radios, or lights); as this could cause spark/ignition;</li>
<li>Abandon equipment being used in/near area;</li>
<li>Avoid open flames;</li>
<li>Prevent individuals from entering area;</li>
<li>Call <b><a href="tel:911">911</a></b> or contact the local fire/law enforcement from a safe location; and</li>
<li>Notify pipeline operator.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Considerations For Establishing Protective Action Distance:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Type of product (eg. sour vs sweet);</li>
<li>Pressure/diameter of pipe;</li>
<li>Timing of valve closure by utility (quickly for automated valves/longer for manually operated valves);</li>
<li>Dissipation time of material in pipe once valves closed;</li>
<li>Heat factor of product;</li>
<li>Local variables such as climate/weather, wind direction, topography, population density, demographics and fire suppression methods available for use;</li>
<li>Nearby building construction material/density;</li>
<li>Wild land/urban interface; and</li>
<li>Natural and man-made barriers (highway).</li>
</ul>


<p>If you know the material involved, identify the three-digit guide number by looking up the name in the alphabetical list (blue-bordered pages), then using the three-digit guide number, consult the recommendations in the assigned guide.</p>


<p><b>U.S. Pipeline Resources</b></p>
<p><u>U.S. Pipeline Location Source:</u> The National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) < <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov">http://www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov</a> > indicates the locations of hazardous liquids and natural gas transmission pipelines found within the U.S.</p>

<p><u>U.S. Pipeline Training:</u> Where appropriate, reference Pipeline Emergencies training materials, produced by PHMSA and the National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM). This training guide is available at < <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pipelineemergencies.com">http://www.pipelineemergencies.com</a>  > and offers a thorough overview of U.S. pipeline operations and emergency response considerations.</p>
